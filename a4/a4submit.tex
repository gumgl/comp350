\begin{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item After many hours of staring at this problem, clicking every Google result on the topic and not having a single clue, I give up. No idea what is going on or even where to start. I don't see why Newton's method doesn't converge quadratically with multiple roots. I don't even understand why adding the $m$ in this ``modified'' method is better than Newton's method or why it changes the rate of convergence.
\item We start with the Taylor series expansion of $f(x)$ about $x_0$:
\begin{align*}
f(x) &= f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x-x_0) + \frac{f''(x_0)}{2}(x-x_0)^2 \\
f(x) &= f(x_0) + \Big(f'(x_0) + \frac{f''(x_0)}{2}(x-x_0)\Big) (x-x_0)
\end{align*}
We use the facts that $f(x)=0$ and $(x-x_0)=-\frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)}$ (Newton's method):
\begin{align*}
0 &= f(x_0) + \Big(f'(x_0) - \frac{f''(x_0)}{2} \cdot \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} \Big) (x-x_0) \\
x-x_0 &= \frac{-f(x_0)}{f'(x_0) - \frac{f''(x_0) f(x_0)}{2 f'(x_0)}} \\
x &= x_0 - \frac{2f(x_0)f'(x_0)}{2\big[f'(x_0)\big]^2 - f(x_0) f''(x_0)} 
\end{align*}
This is also known as Halley's method. See attached file \texttt{halley.m} for its implementation.
\end{enumerate}
\item The computed roots for each methods are in Table \ref{table:roots} and the results of each of their iteration steps are in Tables \ref{table:bisection}, \ref{table:newton}, \ref{table:halley} and \ref{table:secant}. The graph of $y=f(x)$ (in green) and $y=f'(x)$ (in red) are in Figure \ref{fig:q2plot}.

See attached function files \texttt{halley.m} and \texttt{secant.m} for the implementation of the new root-finding methods.

See attached function files \texttt{f.m}, \texttt{fd.m} and \texttt{fdd.m} for the implementation of $f(x)$, $f'(x)$ and $f''(x)$.

See attached script file \texttt{q2.m} for the commands generating the results and the plot. In this case, we used $n_{max}=10^5$, $x_0=1$, $x_1=2$.

As we can see, Halley's method is the fastest with 3 iterations since it has cubic convergence but it requires $f'(x)$ and $f''(x)$. Newton's method comes as a close second with 4 iterations since it converges quadratically but requires $f'(x)$. Not far after, the secant method converging super-linearly takes 8 iterations to reach the same degree of precision without requiring a derivative of $f(x)$. Then far behind the others, the bisection method took 40 iterations. That is 5 times more than the next fastest method and more than 13 times more than the fastest, because it has linear convergence.
